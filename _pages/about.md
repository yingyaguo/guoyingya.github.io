I am now an associate professor and master supervisor in College of Computer and Data Science, Fuzhou University. I am also the High Level Talents of Fujian (B level). I received the B.S degree in computer science from Xiamen University, China, in 2013 and Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University in 2019 (Supervisor: Jianping Wu and Xia Yin). During my Ph.D. study, I won the CSC scholarship and studied in Tandon School of New York University as a visiting student under the supervision of Professor H. Jonathan Chao and Professor Yang Xu (now a full professor in Fudan University) during 2017.10-2018.09. I was also a Postdoc in the Polytechnic University of Hong Kong during 2020.11-2021.09 under the supervision of Professor Dan Wang.

My research interests include traffic engineering, routing optimization, resource optimization, traffic anomaly detection, traffic prediction and mobile edge computing. I have authored or coauthored more than 20 research articles published in refereed journals and proceedings, including the IEEE Transaction on Networking, IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, Computer Networks, CONEXT, INFOCOM and ICNP. I served as the TPC member of IWQoS (CCF-B) in 2022. I am also a member of CCF Internet Technical Committee.

I am the leader of the AINET (AI for NETworking) group and focus on solving the computer network problems with AI techniques. If you have interests with my group or want to collaborate with me, please feel free to contact me by sending me emails. I am also looking for self-motivated, diligent students with a good personality. Please drop me emails with your CV after reading this (超链接可以下载PPT) if you want come to my group and let me be your supervisor.

======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
